Q.2 Difference between var,let,const with code examples.
---------------------------------------------------------

1] Var:-

Scope of a var:

var declaration are globally scoped or function /locally scoped.
The scope is global when we declare var outside the function.This means that when we declare var outside the function it available in all program.

var is function scoped.This means that when we declare var inside any function that is available only in the function.

Ex. 

var abc="Hello";
function newFunction()
{
var pqr="Let'sUpgrade";
} 

console.log(pqr);//error:hello is not defined

Here,abc is globally scoped because it is outside the function while pqr is function scoped so it is not available outside the function.

var veriable redeclared and updated:

Ex.

var hello="Let'sUpgrade";
var hello="Day 1 Assignment";

hello="JS";
========================================================================

2]Let:

Scope of a let:

let is block scoped.
so veriable declared inside function block with let is only available for use within block.

Ex.

   let greeting = "say Hi";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

We can see that hello is defined inside the block,so it can not accesible outside the block.

let can be updated but not re-declared:

This means that let veriable updated but can't redeclared.

Ex.

let great="Hello";

great="JS";

let great="Web Devlopment";//error:Identifier great is already defined.
==========================================================================
3]Const:

const declarations is block scoped:

const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

const cannot be updated or re-declared:
This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.

Ex.
const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
===============================================================================
